A significant contribution of this work is to present unique retinal images from a specialized hospital of all the ocular diseases located in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Bangladesh Eye Hospital (BEH). The color fundus images were taken by a Topcon Retinal Camera TRC-50DX, which is considered the gold standard for retinal imaging. The retinal images were obtained over a timespan of two years, i.e., from 2019 to 2020, and from various Bangladeshi patients aged between 35 to 80. The diagnosis of glaucoma in the optic nerve head (ONH) was performed by two ocular disease professionals, a pediatric ophthalmologist and a glaucoma and refractive surgeon. Finally, the obtained dataset contains 463 normal (nonglaucoma) and 171 glaucoma color fundus images.
Glaucoma (171), Normal (463)
